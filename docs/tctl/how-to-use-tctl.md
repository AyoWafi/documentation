> The Temporal tctl documentation covers version 1.16 of the Temporal CLI.

:::note

This page is temporary. We plan to move the information to other pages.

:::

## Quick Start

- Run `tctl -h` for help on top-level commands and global options
- Run `tctl namespace -h` for help on namespace operations
- Run `tctl workflow -h` for help on Workflow operations
- Run `tctl taskqueue -h` for help on Task Queue operations

**Note:** Ensure you have a Temporal Server running before using CLI.

### Namespace operation examples

#### Recovery from bad deployment -- auto-reset workflow

If a bad deployment lets a workflow run into a wrong state, you might want to reset the workflow to the point that the bad deployment started to run.
But usually it is not easy to find out all the workflows impacted, and every reset point for each workflow.
In this case, auto-reset will automatically reset all the workflows given a bad deployment identifier.

Let's get familiar with some concepts.
Each deployment will have an identifier, we call it "**Binary Checksum**" as it is usually generated by the md5sum of a binary file.
For a workflow, each binary checksum will be associated with an **auto-reset point**, which contains a **runId**, an **eventID**, and the **created_time** that binary/deployment made the first command for the workflow.

To find out which **binary checksum** of the bad deployment to reset, you should be aware of at least one workflow running into a bad state.
Use the describe command with **--reset_points_only** option to show all the reset points:

```bash
tctl workflow desc -w <WorkflowId>  --reset_points_only
+----------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+
|         BINARY CHECKSUM          |          CREATE TIME           |                RUNID                 | EVENTID |
+----------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+
| c84c5afa552613a83294793f4e664a7f | 2019-05-24 10:01:00.398455019  | 2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1 |       4 |
| aae748fdc557a3f873adbe1dd066713f | 2019-05-24 11:01:00.067691445  | d42d21b8-2adb-4313-b069-3837d44d6ce6 |       4 |
...
...
```

Then use this command to tell Temporal to auto-reset all Workflows impacted by the bad deployment.
The command stores the bad binary checksum into namespace info and triggers a process to reset all your Workflows.

```bash
tctl --ns <YourNamespace> namespace update --add_bad_binary aae748fdc557a3f873adbe1dd066713f  --reason "rollback bad deployment"
```

After you add the checksum of the bad binary to your namespace, Temporal will not dispatch any command tasks to the bad binary.
So make sure that you have rolled back to a good deployment(or roll out new bits with bug fixes).
Otherwise your workflow can't make any progress after auto-reset.

#### Secure connection to Temporal cluster

`tctl` supports optional Transport Level Security (TLS) for secure communication with Temporal, authentication of the server, and authentication of the client (mutual TLS).

`--tls_ca_path=<certificate file path>` command line argument that passes a certificate authority (CA) certificate for the validating server that `tctl` is connecting to.

`--tls_cert_path=<certificate file path>` command line argument that passes a client certificate for the server to validate the client (`tctl`) identity. Requires that `--tls_key_path` is also provided.

`--tls_key_path=<private key file path>` command line argument that passes a private key associated with the client certificate supplied with the --tls_cert_path setting.

`--tls_disable_host_verification` command line argument that disables verification of the server certificate, i.e. host verification.

`--tls_server_name=<server name>` command line argument that passes an override value for the target server that is used for TLS host verification.
It also enables host verification. The value must be one of the DNS names listed in the server TLS certificate.

TLS command-line arguments can be provided via their respective environment variables to shorten the command line.

### Add custom Search Attributes to a Cluster

:::note
see file
:::

## Start Workflow with Search Attributes

```bash
tctl workflow start \
  --taskqueue helloWorldGroup \
  --workflow_type main.Workflow \
  --execution_timeout 60 \
  --input '"john"' \
  --search_attr_key 'CustomIntField | CustomKeywordField | CustomStringField | CustomBoolField | CustomDatetimeField' \
  --search_attr_value '5 | keyword1 | john test | true | 2019-06-07T16:16:36-08:00'
```

### Workflow Id Uniqueness

Let's take a look at the Workflow Id semantic.
When starting a Workflow without providing an Id, the client generates one in the form of a UUID.
In most real-life scenarios this is not a desired behavior. The business Id should be used instead.
Here, we'll specify the Id when starting a Workflow:

```bash
tctl workflow start  --workflow_id "HelloTemporal1" --taskqueue HelloWorldTaskQueue --workflow_type HelloWorld --execution_timeout 3600 --input \"Temporal\"
```

CLI output:

```text
Started Workflow Id: HelloTemporal1, run Id: 78ca0a3f-8cd2-46a2-8d23-076c3f0f187c
```

Now the list operation is more meaningful as the WORKFLOW ID is our business Id:

```bash
tctl workflow list
```

CLI output:

```text
     WORKFLOW TYPE    |      WORKFLOW ID      |                RUN ID                | START TIME | EXECUTION TIME | END TIME
  HelloWorld_sayHello | HelloTemporal1        | 78ca0a3f-8cd2-46a2-8d23-076c3f0f187c | 01:47:24   | 01:47:24       | 01:47:25
```

After the previous Workflow completes, let's try to start another one with the same Id:

```bash
tctl workflow start  --workflow_id "HelloTemporal1" --taskqueue HelloWorldTaskQueue --workflow_type HelloWorld --execution_timeout 3600 --input \"Temporal\"
```

Output:

```text
Started Workflow Id: HelloTemporal1, run Id: 9b5e36a3-9868-4de5-bbdf-eda9cedcd865
```

After the second start, list Workflows with:

```bash
tctl workflow list
```

CLI output:

```text
  WORKFLOW TYPE |             WORKFLOW ID              |                RUN ID                |     TASK QUEUE      | START TIME | EXECUTION TIME | END TIME
  HelloWorld    | HelloTemporal1                       | 0514b7fe-6ba7-4f94-ad1a-60557018da7b | HelloWorldTaskQueue | 20:44:40   | 20:44:40       | 20:44:40
  HelloWorld    | HelloTemporal1                       | a90989f0-e629-46c8-9dbd-f7e6c374ceea | HelloWorldTaskQueue | 20:43:36   | 20:43:36       | 20:43:36
```

As you can see Workflow Id can be reused while system-generated Run Id uniquely identifies a particular execution of a Workflow.

Note - Under no circumstances does Temporal allow more than one instance of an open Workflow with the same Id.
Multiple Workflow Ids are required in the case that paralell invocations wish to be supported (such as an Actor patern)

Use 'cluster get-search-attr' cmd to list legal keys and value types
```

## Debugging with tctl

Start a new Workflow execution without a running Worker:

```bash
$ tctl workflow start  --workflow_id "HelloActivityWorker" --taskqueue HelloWorldTaskQueue --workflow_type HelloWorld_sayHello --execution_timeout 3600 --input \"World\"
Started Workflow Id: HelloActivityWorker, run Id: ff015637-b5af-43e8-b3f6-8b6c7b919b62
```

The Workflow is started, but nothing visible happens.
This is expected because the corresponding Worker is not running.
What are the options to understand the currently running Workflow state?

### `tctl workflow stack`

The first option is look at the stack trace:

```text
$ tctl workflow stack  --workflow_id "HelloActivityWorker"
Query result as JSON:
"workflow-root: (BLOCKED on Feature.get)io.temporal.internal.sync.CompletablePromiseImpl.get(CompletablePromiseImpl.java:71)
io.temporal.internal.sync.ActivityStubImpl.execute(ActivityStubImpl.java:58)
io.temporal.internal.sync.ActivityInvocationHandler.lambda$invoke$0(ActivityInvocationHandler.java:87)
io.temporal.internal.sync.ActivityInvocationHandler$$Lambda$25/1816732716.apply(Unknown Source)
io.temporal.internal.sync.ActivityInvocationHandler.invoke(ActivityInvocationHandler.java:94)
com.sun.proxy.$Proxy6.say(Unknown Source)
io.temporal.samples.hello.GettingStarted$HelloWorldImpl.sayHello(GettingStarted.java:55)
sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)
"
```

It shows that the Workflow code is blocked on the "say" method of a Proxy object that implements the Activity stub.
You can restart the Workflow worker if you want to make sure that restarting it does not change that.
It works for Activities of any duration.
It is okay for the Workflow code to block on an Activity invocation for a month for example.

### `tctl workflow describe`

Another useful API is `DescribeWorkflowExecution` which, among other information, contains the list of outstanding Activities:

```text
$ tctl workflow describe  --workflow_id "HelloActivityWorker"
{
  "ExecutionConfiguration": {
    "taskQueue": {
      "name": "HelloWorldTaskQueue"
    },
    "executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds": 3600,
    "taskStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds": 10,
    "childPolicy": "TERMINATE"
  },
  "WorkflowExecutionInfo": {
    "Execution": {
      "workflowId": "HelloActivityWorker",
      "runId": "ff015637-b5af-43e8-b3f6-8b6c7b919b62"
    },
    "Type": {
      "name": "HelloWorld_sayHello"
    },
    "StartTime": "2019-06-08T23:56:41Z",
    "CloseTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "Status": null,
    "HistoryLength": 5,
    "ParentNamespaceId": null,
    "ParentExecution": null,
    "AutoResetPoints": {}
  },
  "PendingActivities": [
    {
      "ActivityId": "0",
      "ActivityType": {
        "name": "HelloWorldActivities_say"
      },
      "State": "SCHEDULED",
      "ScheduledTimestamp": "2019-06-08T23:57:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's start the Activity worker.
It starts and immediately prints:

```text
1: Hello World!
```

Let's look at the Workflow execution history:

```text
$ tctl workflow show  --workflow_id "HelloActivityWorker"
   1  WorkflowExecutionStarted  {WorkflowType:{Name:HelloWorld_sayHello},
                                TaskQueue:{Name:HelloWorldTaskQueue},
                                Input:["World"],
                                ExecutionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds:3600,
                                TaskStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds:10,
                                ContinuedFailureDetails:[],
                                LastCompletionResult:[],
                                Identity:temporal-cli@linuxkit-025000000001,

                                FirstWorkflowTaskBackoffSeconds:0}
   2  WorkflowTaskScheduled     {TaskQueue:{Name:HelloWorldTaskQueue},
                                StartToCloseTimeoutSeconds:10,
                                Attempt:0}
   3  WorkflowTaskStarted       {ScheduledEventId:2,
                                Identity:37694@maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6,
                                RequestId:1d7cba6d-98c8-41fd-91b1-c27dffb21c7f}
   4  WorkflowTaskCompleted     {ExecutionContext:[],
                                ScheduledEventId:2,
                                StartedEventId:3,
                                Identity:37694@maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6}
   5  ActivityTaskScheduled     {ActivityId:0,
                                ActivityType:{Name:HelloWorldActivities_say},
                                TaskQueue:{Name:HelloWorldTaskQueue},
                                Input:["1: Hello World!"],
                                ScheduleToCloseTimeoutSeconds:300,
                                ScheduleToStartTimeoutSeconds:300,
                                StartToCloseTimeoutSeconds:300,
                                HeartbeatTimeoutSeconds:300,
                                WorkflowTaskCompletedEventId:4}
   6  ActivityTaskStarted       {ScheduledEventId:5,
                                Identity:37784@maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6,
                                RequestId:a646d5d2-566f-4f43-92d7-6689139ce944,
                                Attempt:0}
   7  ActivityTaskCompleted     {Result:[], ScheduledEventId:5,
                                StartedEventId:6,
                                Identity:37784@maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6}
   8  WorkflowTaskScheduled     {TaskQueue:{Name:maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6:fd3a85ed-752d-4662-a49d-2665b7667c8a},
                                StartToCloseTimeoutSeconds:10, Attempt:0}
   9  WorkflowTaskStarted       {ScheduledEventId:8,
                                Identity:fd3a85ed-752d-4662-a49d-2665b7667c8a,
                                RequestId:601ef30a-0d1b-4400-b034-65b8328ad34c}
  10  WorkflowTaskCompleted     {ExecutionContext:[],
                                ScheduledEventId:8,
                                StartedEventId:9,
                                Identity:37694@maxim-C02XD0AAJGH6}
```

_ActivityTaskStarted_ event is recorded when the Activity task is picked up by an Activity worker.
The Identity field contains the Id of the worker (you can set it to any value on worker startup).

_ActivityTaskCompleted_ event is recorded when Activity completes.
It contains the result of the Activity execution.

## Securing `tctl`

`tctl` supports plugins that can be used to set headers on outgoing requests.

We ship an [example plugin](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/cmd/tools/cli/plugins/authorization/main.go) that supports HTTP Basic Auth headers (to be used in tandem with a [secure Temporal Server](/server/security/). You can enable it with:

```bash
tctl --headers_provider_plugin tctl-authorization-plugin
```

The value `tctl-authorization-plugin` above is just a name of a binary - plugins are decoupled from `tctl` itself via Hashicorp's go-plugin interface.
In other words, if you need to customize or add your own plugins, you don't have to rebuild `tctl` itself; just compile your plugin to a binary.
